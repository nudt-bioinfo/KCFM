# Notebooks for the downstream task of KCFM
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks necessary to reproduce the benchmarking results presented in the paper. Each experiment includes detailed data, which is available within the respective notebooks. All experimental results can be reproduced using the provided scripts for various methods. For more information, visit the https://github.com/nudt-bioinfo/KCFM/tree/main/KCFM_tutorial.

This tutorial mainly includes notebooks for five downstream tasks, including cell atlases annotation,fine-grained cell type annotation ([T_cancer_cell](https://github.com/nudt-bioinfo/KCFM/tree/main/KCFM_tutorial/T_cancer_cell)), novel cell classification ([novel_cell_classification_bert](https://github.com/nudt-bioinfo/KCFM/tree/main/KCFM_tutorial/novel_cell_classification_bert)), spatial transcriptomics analysis under extreme data sparsity ([spatial_transcriptomics](https://github.com/nudt-bioinfo/KCFM/tree/main/KCFM_tutorial/spatial_transcriptomics)), gene perturbation analysis ([gene purterbation](https://github.com/nudt-bioinfo/KCFM/tree/main/KCFM_tutorial/gene%20purterbation))
